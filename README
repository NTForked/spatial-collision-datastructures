This project is a benchmark tool used to access performance of different collision detection 
data structures. Most of these data structures were taken Christer Ericson's Real-Time collision
detection (Morgan Kaufmann Publishers 2004) book. The Kd-Tree SAH idea was taken from
Maxim Shevtsov, Alexei Soupikov and Alexander Kapustin, Intel Corporation, 2007, Highly Parallel 
Fast KD‐tree Construction for Interactive Ray  Tracing of Dynamic Scenes paper.

The implemented data structures are: Bruteforce (for reference), Sort and Sweep (Sweep and Prune),
Uniform Grid, Hierarchical Grid, Octree, Loose Octree, Kd-Tree (using SAH).

A small demo application was written (using GLUT) to help visualize and compare the tested data structures.
